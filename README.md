Epiquation

  Epiquation is software that will help people working with or manipulating
  mathematics. The software will have to help them solve mathematical equations
  that are complex or not. It will be very useful to check his answers and work 
  math, this software will solve equations of any kind.

HOW IT WORKS ?
  For make (BUILD) the project :
    In the terminal write "make" and write ./main [ARGUMENT]

  [ARGUMENT] = function you need
    Examlpes :
        ./main ln(4x) = 0
        result = 0.250000

WHAT CAN WE DO ?

  Actualy we can just resolv equation with simple variable (view examplke).
